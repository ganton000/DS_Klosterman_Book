This folder has a series of files which follows the works of Data Science Projects with Python by Stephen Klosterman.
In this project, we will explore Data cleaning and parsing using Pandas, visualization of Data using Matplotlib and Seaborn, Quality Assurance of Data through Pandas and cognitive thinking along with Feature Exploration. We also dive into Machine Learning algorithms/techniques, when they are best applied and the pros/cons of each given model. We talk about coming up with dummy test sets, different Metric evaluation for Classification models and a deep understanding of some scikit-learn scripts.
